      "message": "David, This looks good.  I only have one minor comment.  We should also discuss how this is used at some point.  \n\nThere is some overlay of the data stored in change-info and attempt-info.  The overlay is last_updated_by and last_updated.  An idea might be to organize as follows:\n\nChange-info\n    Last_updated\n    Last-updated-by\n\nAttempt-info\n     Choice\n         Case Success\n         Case Error\n\nYou would always save both change-info and attempt-info in the synchronization and communication containers. \n\nYou could also save either success for error using the choice statement.\n\nEither way will work.",
