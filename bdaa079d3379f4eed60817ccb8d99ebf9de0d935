      "message": "David, This looks good.  I only have one minor comment.  We should also discuss how this is used at some point.  \n\nThere is some overlay of the data stored in change-info and attempt-info.  The overlay is last_updated_by and last_updated.  An idea might be to organize as follows:\n\nChange-info\n    Last_updated\n    Last-updated-by\n\nAttempt-info\n     Choice\n         Case Success\n         Case Error\n\nYou would always save both change-info and attempt-info in the synchronization and communication containers. \n\nYou could also save either success for error using the choice statement.\n\nEither way will work.",

      "message": "A couple of thoughts here. Wondering if we really need a last_success_by and last_attempt_by as opposed a single last_update_by for the attempt_info. \n\nOne reason I am staying away from a choice, I think even if the last attempt was a success, then I am thinking that we still may want to keep around the last fail time, not positive, but thinking about it. I know the reverse is true that if the last attempt failed you would want to know when the last success was.",
